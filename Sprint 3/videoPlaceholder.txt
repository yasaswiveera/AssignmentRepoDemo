This video demonstrates the successful execution of four test cases (TC01–TC04) for the NotificationSystem 
used in our medication reminder program. The tests cover positive, negative, boundary, and invalid input scenarios 
to validate system behavior. All test cases pass and confirm that reminders are triggered correctly, notifications 
are blocked when disabled, exact times are handled accurately, and invalid data is properly rejected.
