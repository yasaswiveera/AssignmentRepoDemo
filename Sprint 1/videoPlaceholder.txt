Overview:
The Sprint 1 video shows both positive, boundary, and negative test cases for the Medication Tracker system. 
The positive test case checks that a doctor can add a prescription and the patient can log a dose correctly, 
showing that the main features work as expected. The boundary test case checks if the system accepts the earliest 
valid time, 00:00, when logging a dose, and it passes successfully. The negative test cases include one with an 
invalid null medication, and another with an empty dosage, both showing that the program handles errors properly by rejecting 
incorrect inputs. Overall, the video shows that the system works correctly for valid inputs and responds properly to
invalid ones.
