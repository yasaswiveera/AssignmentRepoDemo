Medication Reminder & Tracker is a Java-based web/phone application that helps patients manage their medications by providing an online calendar view and timely reminder notifications. The system stores medication schedules and adherence logs in simple Java-managed files, while also calculating each patientâ€™s adherence percentage. Patients can easily input their medications and times through the website, receive automated reminders, and record whether they have taken each dose. Doctors can log in to view adherence summaries, making the tool an accessible way to improve patient compliance and healthcare outcomes.
